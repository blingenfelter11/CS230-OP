  The Gaming Room wants to develop a web based game that can run on multiple platforms. The game is called "Draw It or Loose It" and has multiple teams competing in four rounds at a minute each. I was sufficient at adequality compiling the information necessary to complete the software design document. Compiling the information and having it organized in the design document is beneficial for developing the code. I digested the needs of the user through a funnel to break down their needs and find the appropriate data to satisfy the users requirements. It is important to satisfy the users needs to create an appropriate design that will satisfy the requirements of the project.
